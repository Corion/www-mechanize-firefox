TO DO:
    . Improve test coverage of methods
    . Add test for ->value with 3-args (setting)
    . Add test for ->highlight_node()
    . Add test for ->clickables()
    . Add test for getting/setting ->autodie()
    . Add test for getting/setting ->events()
    . Add 2-arg test for ->synchronize()
    . Make ->set_visible actually use ->field()
      so it can also set select fields?!
    . Make ->set_visible also support select+option inputs
    . Add tests for _field_by_name for #foo and .foo case

0.78 20141026
    . Pull in fixed prerequisite MozRepl::RemoteObject v0.39
    . Test fixes

0.77 20141020
    + Actually support coordinates for ->click({...}, $x, $y )
    . Test fixes

0.76 20140810
    . Fix a POD error, causing a POD self-test to fail
    . No need to upgrade from 0.75

0.75 20140727
    + Be even more paranoid about environment variables in Test::HTTP::LocalServer
      (change gleaned from WWW::Mechanize , as contributed by Karen Etheridge)
    + Allow the 'node' parameter to ->get_set_value() to fire the appropriate
      Javascript events when setting a field value.
    + Updated installation instructions and troubleshooting instructions

    + ->xpath() now returns the best result depending on the query.
      This result type depends on the Firefox XPath implementation.
        //p will return a list of nodes
        string-length(//p) will return a list of string lengths
      To force the old behaviour, you need to call ->xpath() with
      the following option:

        $mech->xpath( $query,
            type => $mech->xpathResult('ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE')
        );
      Implementation and tests contributed by dfaure again

      each query result instead of returning the best guess

      version has problems with GPU acceleration. Debugging the exact conditions

    . Use the ugly cross-version hack of
        translate(local-name(.), 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
      to accomodate for Firefox 3.0 having UPPERCASE HTML ELEMENT NAMES

      query - if this breaks your code, please supply test cases!

0.45 20110208
    . eval_in_page raises errors from perspective of the caller
      instead of raising errors in Firefox.pm
    . Added ->by_id() method and { id => $id } option for
      conveniently finding elements with names that ->selector
      interprets as CSS selectors.
    . Improved tests checking fields with fancy:names
      or fancy:ids

0.44 20100130

      (provided by ysth, thanks)
    . Bump MozRepl::RemoteObject to 0.21 for better cleanup logic

0.43 20110109
    ! Fix MozRepl::RemoteObject prerequisite version number
    ! Change event filtering logic for load progress listener to
      just pre-filter, and keep the main logic in Perl. This
      should fix intermittent crashes.
    . Add 'no_cache' option to ->get()

0.42 20110106
    . Improved subroutine coverage to 95% on WWW::Mechanize::Firefox
    . Add test for ->forms in scalar context
    . Add test for ->forms in list context
    . Add test for ->reload()
    . Add test for ->back()
    . Add test for ->forward()
    . Add test for ->is_html()
    . ->back() / ->forward() now can optionally (not) synchronize
      for loading local files
    . Move page load progress listener into JS to reduce latency
    . Added ->on_event() accessor for convenient JS page load event debugging

0.41 20101211
    . Remove failing test that didn't respect localized theme names
    . Fix (i)frame tests that didn't produce results due to embedding sites 
      that didn't load.
    . Proxies in Firefox should impede test results less
    . FRAME tags are handled somewhat differently between Firefox and Mechanize:
      Firefox is less lenient than WWW::Mechanize
    . Use the new ->constant() mechanism of MozRepl::RemoteObject to improve
      latency
    . ->set_fields() now actually works and has a test
    . Started monitoring code coverage through Devel::Cover
    . Reinstate `use_queue` that was broken in 0.39
    . ->synchronize() now captures events from the tab and the browser

0.40 20101122
    + HTTP::Cookies::MozRepl now fetches cookies more quickly
    + Other functions also use bulk fetching for quicker
      information retrieval
    . The tests are now more resilient for proxies that return other
      "no DNS" errors than 500.

0.39 20101120
    . Add Firefox::Application to contain UI manipulation things.
      The ->{repl} element is now not a hash element of WWW::Mechanize::Firefox
      anymore, but you shouldn't access the guts of an object anyway.
      Use ->repl instead.
    ! ->addTab , ->createTab, ->activateTab and ->selectedTab have been moved
      to Firefox::Application.
      If you used these functions before, change:
          $mech->addTab( ... )
      to 
          $mech->application->addTab( ... )
    ! ->set_tab_content has been moved to Firefox::Application
    ! WWW::Mechanize::Firefox (by virtue of Firefox::Application) now uses
      the command queueing feature of MozRepl::RemoteObject. The change
      should be invisible in theory, but as Javascript objects now experience
      a short delay in when they get released, it might change the behaviour
      of Firefox. If you experience different behaviour, please test with
          use_queue => 1
      and
          use_queue => 0
      whether the difference actually stems from the queuing behaviour.

0.38 20101119
    . Fix test for checking whether JS is enabled and whether it can be
      disabled to also work when the NoScript add-on is not installed.
    ! Fix test and code for ->response (and ->get()) when a HTTP proxy
      is set. This means that if you have a proxy, some of the response
      codes may differ from what you saw before. Some responses are now
      404 or 500 responses where they returned undef before.
    ! The response code should now more closely correspond to the first
      response actually fetched.
    . Always store (a reference to) the Javascript response even if we
      don't fetch it immediately.
    . The examples now have a common hashbang line
    . The examples don't use a private library directory anymore

0.37 20101115
    . Switch out the code in WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::DSL
      in favour of Object::Import, which is the same codebase
      but intended for a wider audience than just W:M:F.
    . ->current_form now gets reset on ->get and ->submit
    . The C<any> option to ->xpath() (and ->selector, ->is_visible,...)
      allows to search for multiple nodes that may or may not exist

0.36 20101017
    . Fix the mro.pm 5.10+ prerequisite by using the additional prerequisite
      MRO::Compat, which provides a transparent switch between mro.pm and its 
      own implementation for versions <5.9.x.
    . Make `use WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::DSL '$mech'` work silently
    . JS Errors when using ::DSL now get raised in the user code and not
      in ::Firefox or ::DSL

0.35 20101014
    . Improve the error message of ->value() when no element is found
    . Implement ->tick() and ->untick()

0.34 20101013
    . Make ->follow_link() also respect C<synchronize> by making ->follow_link()
      mostly synonymous with ->click()
    . Document the C<dom> option to ->click() (noted by M. Schwern)
    . ->click(undef) now fails
    . Optimized ->get_set_field() to only return a value if it's needed. This
      should speed up setting values in selectboxes.
    . Added section in Troubleshooting.pod on what C<synchronize> can be
      used for.

0.33 20100819
    . Add ->activateTab() for setting the currently displayed tab
    . Now needs MozRepl::RemoteObject 0.13 as a prerequisite
    . Add activate => 1 option to constructor
    . Remove ->content_utf8 , as ->content() already always returns utf8
    + Bring ->field() and ->value() in line with the HTML::Form API
      (and thus the WWW::Mechanize API). Now, very simple CSS
      selectors like #id and .class get accepted in addition
      to 'name' and '^name'.
    + ->value() now also returns the values for select+option elements

0.32 20100810
    . Add WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::FAQ as a list of frequently asked
      questions. As people now actually ask questions, this file
      has a reason to exist.
    . Add WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::Troubleshooting as a document
      for things that still need to be implemented. Also list
      workarounds.
    . Add example for how to change Firefox settings.
    . Change code for closing a tab so it works dynamically
    . Add method ->closeTab for closing arbitrary tabs and a test for it
    . Add experimental ->content_utf8 method that always tries to decode
      the content.
    ! All HTTP::Response objects now use ->content_utf8() instead of
      expecting the content to be in utf8. This may break your
      encoding-sensitive code, so please send me test cases where it breaks
      for you.

0.31 20100713
    . ->get now supports the :local_file shortcut for local saving
    . WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::Cookbook contains snippets
    . Documentation is more unified, short examples of function usage

0.30 20100711
    . Add ->is_visible method to check for node visibility
    . Add ->wait_until_invisible method to wait until a node disappears
    . Add tests for the above
    . Added tail example program for tailing the Javascript console
    . Added example program to send messages from the console to the Javascript
      console (intended to delineate the start/stop of test runs)

0.29 20100704
    . Really fix bcat.pl and failing tests
    . Use Firefox XPath library for ->find_link( text_contains => ... )
    . Can't use Firefox XPath library for ->find_link( text_regex => ... )
      as Firefox does not seem to define fn:matches()
    . ->find_link() now really searches only the current frame, as Mechanize does

0.28 20100702
    . Fix bcat.pl and failing tests
    . Add examples on how to access (and follow) the Error Console

0.27 20100701
    . Add the examples to WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::Examples
    . Add test for (dis)allowing META redirects
    . Add author test to ensure Changes well-formedness
    . Fix 'one' option to ->xpath() to correctly fail when no element is found
    . Fix behaviour of ->click() to correctly fail if no element is found
      when given as a name

0.26 20100630
    . Add bcat.pl example to display text from the console in the browser
    . Make input fields work across frames
    . Add test for fields across frames
    . Make ->field() and ->value() respect the current form if any

0.25 20100629
    . ->submit_form now can submit the current form without any fields
      specified. This was a fatal error before.
    . The Javascript code for closing a tab is now much shorter and likely
      also more reliable as it does not rely on the most recent window
      opened anymore.
    . ->update_html() does not return anything anymore, just like
      WWW::Mechanize does.
    . C<repl> constructor now also accepts host:port
    . Add `bcat.pl` example script to cat HTML to the browser.

0.24 20100624
    ! ->find_link_dom now uses ->xpath and searches through frames
    ! Actually conform to WWW::Mechanize API by requiring a hashref
      in ->submit_form( with_fields => {} ). This might break your
      code, but it's a small change and makes the code fit the documentation.

0.23 20100624
    . Add "maybe" option to ->xpath (and ->selector)
    . Add "all" option to ->xpath (and ->selector)
    . Add a sanity check that prevents calling ->xpath in scalar
      context if no item-count option is specified.
    . Unified code paths for frame expansion and document query

0.22 20100623
    . Performance optimization:
      ->click() does not need a response
    . ->click() now uses ->xpath() to find elements
    . Add link to WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::Examples
    . Don't force C<synchronize> in ->click()
    . ->xpath also takes an arrayref of queries
    . ->selector also takes an arrayref of queries
    . Added INSTALL file

0.21 20100618
    ! value() method now returns the field value
    ! Frames are now searched by default for matching elements
      Use
          frames => 0
      to prevent searching through frames or
          frames => ['content_frame']
      to whitelist frames to be searched

0.20 20100610
    . Fix links in example documentation
    . Add tests for weirdo names containing square brackets
    . Fix finding fields that have square brackets in their attributes

0.19 20100603
    . Added example programs
    . Generate example documentation by script from John McNamara

0.18 20100518
    . ->submit() returns a true value now
    . added another test
    . Add test and fix bug in ->form_with_fields, which never worked properly
    . Add test and fix bug in ->form_name, which never worked at all

0.17 20100426
    . Don't only request nsiHttpChannel, also use it instead of $request
    . Fix warnings in test suite
    . Add ->eval() as synonym for ->eval_in_page()
    . Fix distribution MANIFEST

0.16 20100425
    . Added ->submit
    . Added ->submit_form with_fields => [...]
    . Bugfix: Explicitly ask for the nsiHTTPChannel when trying to
      create a response

      in response to http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=811436

0.12 20091130
    ! Renamed to ::Firefox
      This affects all your scripts, unfortunately.
    . Added ->save_url for downloading content to disk
    . Added ->save_document for downloading the current document to disk

    . Guard against empty/undefined schemes when constructing the JS response
    . Add and document a method to launch Firefox if it's not already running.

0.11 20091126
    . Implement real HTTP response codes instead of the faked
      response codes.
    * Fix a memory leak/cycle that prevented tabs from closing
    . Now needs MozRepl::RemoteObject 0.10 for the API to deregister
      callbacks.

0.10 20091121
    . implemented ->form_name, ->form_id, ->form_number
    . unified API between ->find_link, ->selector, ->xpath
    . Needs MozRepl::RemoteObject 0.09 to ensure that
      multiple $mech instances work
    
0.09 20091111
    . Allow ->eval_in_page() to specify an overriding
      environment, for example to override alert()

0.08 20091109
    . Make tests warn if I suspect that Javascript is
      blocked by Noscript. This makes some tests fail.
    . Require latest MozRepl::RemoteObject for sane encoding handling.

0.07 20091106
    . added ->eval_in_page() to evaluate Javascript in
      the context of the page
    . added better frame / iframe handling.
    o Frame/iframes don't play well with data: URLs.

    . Added ->cookies method for cookie access

0.04 20091029

    . added log passthrough parameter

0.03 20091028
    . Added missing MIME::Base64 prerequisite
