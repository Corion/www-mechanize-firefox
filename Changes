TO DO:
    . Improve test coverage of methods
    . Add test for ->value with 3-args (setting)
    . Add test for ->highlight_node()
    . Add test for ->clickables()
    . Add test for getting/setting ->autodie()
    . Add test for getting/setting ->events()
    . Add 2-arg test for ->synchronize()
    . Make ->set_visible actually use ->field()
      so it can also set select fields?!
    . Make ->set_visible also support select+option inputs
    . Add tests for _field_by_name for #foo and .foo case

    . Fix cloning of values for ->eval_in_page was broken by FF 30+

    * Typo fixes in XPath expressions in the documentation (Jerrad Pierce)
    * ->get_local now accepts a basedir option
    * Tightened (test) prerequisites
    * Removed Test::HTTP::LocalServer from inc/
    * Note that this module needs Firefox 54 or earlier
    * Waterfox doesn't currently work, patches welcome!
    * Fixed RT88100
    * Various test stability fixes
      
0.79 2016-05-24
    * Remove the 'pagehide' event from events that are considered
      completion events for a loaded page
      
      This should improve the stability of the test suite and other
      programs. If you find that some programs don't work anymore,
      you will need to add 'pagehide' to the 'events' array.
    * Fix spurious debug output (contributed by ???)
    * Fix ->save_url for Firefox 36+ (Thanks to Olivier Trichet)
      Firefox isn't as tied to backwards compatibility as Perl is:
       https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIWebBrowserPersist#saveURI()
    * Fix infinite loop while waiting (Thanks to Alexander)
    
    * Note that Firefox 40+ doesn't nicely support getting at Javascript
      variables within a page anymore.

    . Fix a POD error, causing a POD self-test to fail
    . No need to upgrade from 0.75

    + Be even more paranoid about environment variables in Test::HTTP::LocalServer
      (change gleaned from WWW::Mechanize , as contributed by Karen Etheridge)
    + Allow the 'node' parameter to ->get_set_value() to fire the appropriate
      Javascript events when setting a field value.

    + ->xpath() now returns the best result depending on the query.
      This result type depends on the Firefox XPath implementation.
        //p will return a list of nodes
        string-length(//p) will return a list of string lengths
      To force the old behaviour, you need to call ->xpath() with
      the following option:

        $mech->xpath( $query,
            type => $mech->xpathResult('ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE')

    . Use the ugly cross-version hack of
        translate(local-name(.), 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
      to accomodate for Firefox 3.0 having UPPERCASE HTML ELEMENT NAMES
      and Firefox 3.6+ having lowercase html element names. Once we move to 4.0

0.46 2011-02-22
    . Add another, more local test for large pages
    . Add hint about bufsize to Troubleshooting.pod

    ! Somewhat experimental squashing of multiple Xpath queries into one
      query - if this breaks your code, please supply test cases!

0.45 2011-02-08
    . eval_in_page raises errors from perspective of the caller
      instead of raising errors in Firefox.pm
    . Added ->by_id() method and { id => $id } option for
      conveniently finding elements with names that ->selector
      interprets as CSS selectors.
    . Improved tests checking fields with fancy:names
      or fancy:ids

0.44 2010-01-30

      (provided by ysth, thanks)
    . Bump MozRepl::RemoteObject to 0.21 for better cleanup logic

0.43 2011-01-09
    ! Fix MozRepl::RemoteObject prerequisite version number
    ! Change event filtering logic for load progress listener to
      just pre-filter, and keep the main logic in Perl. This
      should fix intermittent crashes.
    . Add 'no_cache' option to ->get()

0.42 2011-01-06
    . Improved subroutine coverage to 95% on WWW::Mechanize::Firefox

    . Add test for ->reload()
    . Add test for ->back()
    . Add test for ->forward()
    . Add test for ->is_html()
    . ->back() / ->forward() now can optionally (not) synchronize
      for loading local files
    . Move page load progress listener into JS to reduce latency
    . Added ->on_event() accessor for convenient JS page load event debugging

0.41 2010-12-11
    . Remove failing test that didn't respect localized theme names
    . Fix (i)frame tests that didn't produce results due to embedding sites 
      that didn't load.
    . Proxies in Firefox should impede test results less
    . FRAME tags are handled somewhat differently between Firefox and Mechanize:
      Firefox is less lenient than WWW::Mechanize
    . Use the new ->constant() mechanism of MozRepl::RemoteObject to improve
      latency
    . ->set_fields() now actually works and has a test
    . Started monitoring code coverage through Devel::Cover
    . Reinstate `use_queue` that was broken in 0.39
    . ->synchronize() now captures events from the tab and the browser

0.40 2010-11-22
    + HTTP::Cookies::MozRepl now fetches cookies more quickly
    + Other functions also use bulk fetching for quicker
      information retrieval
    . The tests are now more resilient for proxies that return other
      "no DNS" errors than 500.

0.39 2010-11-20
    . Add Firefox::Application to contain UI manipulation things.
      The ->{repl} element is now not a hash element of WWW::Mechanize::Firefox
      anymore, but you shouldn't access the guts of an object anyway.
      Use ->repl instead.
    ! ->addTab , ->createTab, ->activateTab and ->selectedTab have been moved
      to Firefox::Application.
      If you used these functions before, change:
          $mech->addTab( ... )
      to 
          $mech->application->addTab( ... )
    ! ->set_tab_content has been moved to Firefox::Application
    ! WWW::Mechanize::Firefox (by virtue of Firefox::Application) now uses
      the command queueing feature of MozRepl::RemoteObject. The change
      should be invisible in theory, but as Javascript objects now experience
      a short delay in when they get released, it might change the behaviour
      of Firefox. If you experience different behaviour, please test with
          use_queue => 1
      and
          use_queue => 0
      whether the difference actually stems from the queuing behaviour.

0.38 2010-11-19
    . Fix test for checking whether JS is enabled and whether it can be
      disabled to also work when the NoScript add-on is not installed.
    ! Fix test and code for ->response (and ->get()) when a HTTP proxy
      is set. This means that if you have a proxy, some of the response
      codes may differ from what you saw before. Some responses are now
      404 or 500 responses where they returned undef before.
    ! The response code should now more closely correspond to the first
      response actually fetched.
    . Always store (a reference to) the Javascript response even if we
      don't fetch it immediately.
    . The examples now have a common hashbang line
    . The examples don't use a private library directory anymore

0.37 2010-11-15
    . Switch out the code in WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::DSL
      in favour of Object::Import, which is the same codebase
      but intended for a wider audience than just W:M:F.
    . ->current_form now gets reset on ->get and ->submit
    . The C<any> option to ->xpath() (and ->selector, ->is_visible,...)
      allows to search for multiple nodes that may or may not exist

0.36 2010-10-17
    . Fix the mro.pm 5.10+ prerequisite by using the additional prerequisite
      MRO::Compat, which provides a transparent switch between mro.pm and its 
      own implementation for versions <5.9.x.
    . Make `use WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::DSL '$mech'` work silently
    . JS Errors when using ::DSL now get raised in the user code and not
      in ::Firefox or ::DSL

0.35 2010-10-14
    . Improve the error message of ->value() when no element is found
    . Implement ->tick() and ->untick()

0.34 2010-10-13
    . Make ->follow_link() also respect C<synchronize> by making ->follow_link()
      mostly synonymous with ->click()
    . Document the C<dom> option to ->click() (noted by M. Schwern)
    . ->click(undef) now fails
    . Optimized ->get_set_field() to only return a value if it's needed. This
      should speed up setting values in selectboxes.
    . Added section in Troubleshooting.pod on what C<synchronize> can be
      used for.

0.33 2010-08-19
    . Add ->activateTab() for setting the currently displayed tab
    . Now needs MozRepl::RemoteObject 0.13 as a prerequisite
    . Add activate => 1 option to constructor
    . Remove ->content_utf8 , as ->content() already always returns utf8
    + Bring ->field() and ->value() in line with the HTML::Form API
      (and thus the WWW::Mechanize API). Now, very simple CSS
      selectors like #id and .class get accepted in addition
      to 'name' and '^name'.
    + ->value() now also returns the values for select+option elements

0.32 2010-08-10
    . Add WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::FAQ as a list of frequently asked
      questions. As people now actually ask questions, this file
      has a reason to exist.
    . Add WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::Troubleshooting as a document
      for things that still need to be implemented. Also list
      workarounds.
    . Add example for how to change Firefox settings.
    . Change code for closing a tab so it works dynamically
    . Add method ->closeTab for closing arbitrary tabs and a test for it
    . Add experimental ->content_utf8 method that always tries to decode
      the content.
    ! All HTTP::Response objects now use ->content_utf8() instead of
      expecting the content to be in utf8. This may break your
      encoding-sensitive code, so please send me test cases where it breaks
      for you.

0.31 2010-07-13
    . ->get now supports the :local_file shortcut for local saving
    . WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::Cookbook contains snippets
    . Documentation is more unified, short examples of function usage

0.30 2010-07-11
    . Add ->is_visible method to check for node visibility
    . Add ->wait_until_invisible method to wait until a node disappears
    . Add tests for the above
    . Added tail example program for tailing the Javascript console
    . Added example program to send messages from the console to the Javascript
      console (intended to delineate the start/stop of test runs)

0.29 2010-07-04
    . Really fix bcat.pl and failing tests
    . Use Firefox XPath library for ->find_link( text_contains => ... )
    . Can't use Firefox XPath library for ->find_link( text_regex => ... )
      as Firefox does not seem to define fn:matches()
    . ->find_link() now really searches only the current frame, as Mechanize does

0.28 2010-07-02
    . Fix bcat.pl and failing tests
    . Add examples on how to access (and follow) the Error Console

0.27 2010-07-01
    . Add the examples to WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::Examples
    . Add test for (dis)allowing META redirects
    . Add author test to ensure Changes well-formedness
    . Fix 'one' option to ->xpath() to correctly fail when no element is found
    . Fix behaviour of ->click() to correctly fail if no element is found
      when given as a name

0.26 2010-06-30
    . Add bcat.pl example to display text from the console in the browser
    . Make input fields work across frames
    . Add test for fields across frames
    . Make ->field() and ->value() respect the current form if any

0.25 2010-06-29
    . ->submit_form now can submit the current form without any fields
      specified. This was a fatal error before.
    . The Javascript code for closing a tab is now much shorter and likely
      also more reliable as it does not rely on the most recent window
      opened anymore.
    . ->update_html() does not return anything anymore, just like
      WWW::Mechanize does.
    . C<repl> constructor now also accepts host:port
    . Add `bcat.pl` example script to cat HTML to the browser.

0.24 2010-06-24
    ! ->find_link_dom now uses ->xpath and searches through frames
    ! Actually conform to WWW::Mechanize API by requiring a hashref
      in ->submit_form( with_fields => {} ). This might break your
      code, but it's a small change and makes the code fit the documentation.

0.23 2010-06-24
    . Add "maybe" option to ->xpath (and ->selector)
    . Add "all" option to ->xpath (and ->selector)
    . Add a sanity check that prevents calling ->xpath in scalar
      context if no item-count option is specified.
    . Unified code paths for frame expansion and document query

0.22 2010-06-23
    . Performance optimization:
      ->click() does not need a response
    . ->click() now uses ->xpath() to find elements
    . Add link to WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::Examples
    . Don't force C<synchronize> in ->click()
    . ->xpath also takes an arrayref of queries
    . ->selector also takes an arrayref of queries
    . Added INSTALL file

0.21 2010-06-18
    ! value() method now returns the field value
    ! Frames are now searched by default for matching elements
      Use
          frames => 0
      to prevent searching through frames or
          frames => ['content_frame']
      to whitelist frames to be searched

0.20 2010-06-10
    . Fix links in example documentation
    . Add tests for weirdo names containing square brackets
    . Fix finding fields that have square brackets in their attributes

0.19 2010-06-03

    . Generate example documentation by script from John McNamara

0.18 2010-05-18
    . ->submit() returns a true value now
    . added another test
    . Add test and fix bug in ->form_with_fields, which never worked properly
    . Add test and fix bug in ->form_name, which never worked at all

0.17 2010-04-26
    . Don't only request nsiHttpChannel, also use it instead of $request
    . Fix warnings in test suite
    . Add ->eval() as synonym for ->eval_in_page()
    . Fix distribution MANIFEST

0.16 2010-04-25
    . Added ->submit
    . Added ->submit_form with_fields => [...]
    . Bugfix: Explicitly ask for the nsiHTTPChannel when trying to
      create a response

0.15 2009-12-16
    . Better Makefile.PL and Prereq patch by Alexandr Ciornii (chorny)
    . Removed some dead code
    . Fixed some incompatible Javascript

0.14 2009-12-15
    . Added documentation about bufsize parameter

0.13 2009-12-13
    . Added way to use the "current" tab instead of a new/known tab
    . Fixed a bug regarding reusing tabs
    . Added eg/ directory with examples
    . Added way to specify maximum buffer size at startup
      in response to http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=811436

0.12 2009-11-30
    ! Renamed to ::Firefox
      This affects all your scripts, unfortunately.
    . Added ->save_url for downloading content to disk
    . Added ->save_document for downloading the current document to disk
    . Make ->synchronize and ->click not automatically fetch the response
    . Guard against empty/undefined schemes when constructing the JS response
    . Add and document a method to launch Firefox if it's not already running.

0.11 2009-11-26
    . Implement real HTTP response codes instead of the faked
      response codes.
    * Fix a memory leak/cycle that prevented tabs from closing
    . Now needs MozRepl::RemoteObject 0.10 for the API to deregister
      callbacks.

0.10 2009-11-21
    . implemented ->form_name, ->form_id, ->form_number
    . unified API between ->find_link, ->selector, ->xpath
    . Needs MozRepl::RemoteObject 0.09 to ensure that
      multiple $mech instances work
    
0.09 2009-11-11
    . Allow ->eval_in_page() to specify an overriding
      environment, for example to override alert()

0.08 2009-11-09
    . Make tests warn if I suspect that Javascript is
      blocked by Noscript. This makes some tests fail.
    . Require latest MozRepl::RemoteObject for sane encoding handling.

0.07 2009-11-06
    . added ->eval_in_page() to evaluate Javascript in
      the context of the page
    . added better frame / iframe handling.
    o Frame/iframes don't play well with data: URLs.

    . added ->find_link tests from WWW::Mechanize
    . added sending of focus/change/blur events and API

0.05 2009-10-30

    . added log passthrough parameter

0.03 2009-10-28
    . Added missing MIME::Base64 prerequisite

    . Also requires MozRepl::RemoteObject 0.2 due to the changed call
      interface and introduction of ->declare for caching.

0.02 2009-10-27
    . rearranged documentation
