WWW::Mechanize::Firefox::Troubleshooting - things to watch out for

=head1 Installation

If you notice that tests get skipped and/or the module installs
but "does not seem to work", there are some more steps required
to configure Firefox:

=over 4

=item 1.

Install mozrepl from

L<http://wiki.github.com/bard/mozrepl/>

A direct link is
   
L<http://repo.hyperstruct.net/mozrepl/1.0/mozrepl.xpi>

=item 2.

Launch Firefox

=item 3.

Start C<mozrepl> in Firefox by going to the menu:

   "Tools" -> "MozRepl" -> "Start"

You may want to tick the "Activate on startup" item.

Alternatively, launch the Firefox binary with the C<-mozrepl> command line
switch:

  firefox -mozrepl

If tests still fail, especially t/50-click.t and 51-mech-submit.t ,
this might be because you use the NoScript Mozilla extension
and have it blocking Javascript for file:// URLs. While this is good,
the tests need Javascript enabled.

Solution:

=over 4

=item 1.

Open t/50-click.html in Firefox

=item 2.

Allow Javascript for all file:// URLs

=item 3.

Re-run tests

=item 4.

No test should fail

=head1 Dialogs that break your application

This section lists things that can (and will) happen which might
block your Perl scripts from working properly
with Firefox.

=head2 Save-As Dialog Displays

If a webserver sends the appropriate headers, Firefox will ask the
user where to save a file. This dialog will pop up and stall
the Perl application until a user clicks "OK" to confirm where
to save the file.

=head3 Solution

Find where Firefox pops up the dialog and replace that with a
callback to Perl.

=head3 Workaround

In many cases, you can instruct Firefox to always save files
into the same folder. This may or may not be acceptable.
You can directly call C<< ->get >> or C<< ->save_url >>
and also specify where to save the content by using

  $mech->get( $url, ':content_file' => $tempfile );

or alternatively

  $mech->save_url( $url => $target_filename );

Both of these workarounds require you to know the URL
you want to download.

=head2 Updates to Firefox Add-Ons

The dialog notification for new versions of Add-Ons is not
yet automated. If Firefox pops up this dialog, your application
will stall until a human closes this dialog.

=head3 Solution

Find where Firefox pops up this dialog and override the display either
through a setting or through replacing the Javascript code with
the appropriate Perl code.

=head3 Workaround

Disable checking for and notification about updated Add-Ons.

=head2 Proxy password

If a fresh Firefox process is launched and a proxy is configured,
Firefox will ask for the credentials needed for that proxy.
The Perl script will stall until a human enters or confirms
the credentials.

=head3 Solution

Find where Firefox pops up this dialog and override the display
with a function that supplies the appropriate credentials
directly.

=head3 Workaround

There is no workaround.

=head1 Known Problems

=head2 Page Encoding Versus Perl Encoding

Currently, whatever Firefox delivers as the page content
is assumed to be UTF-8. This is likely not the case in some
situations, for example with pages encoded in koi-8. There is
no real workaround to that. WWW::Mechanize needs to talk
to Firefox to get its guess about the encoding and then
needs to decode the content according to what Firefox
tells it.
